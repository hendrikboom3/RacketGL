Automatically generated OpenGL bindings for Racket.

This project has been forked from the original
   https://github.com/stephanh42/RacketGL
This forked version is not yet usable; don't even try.

I am posting this fork in public in case anyone wishes to comment or assist
in some way, or even just see what's going on.

Khronos has replaced the specfiles used by Stephan Houben's version
with new ones written in xml.  The difference is so severe that the
entire program that reads the specfiles to produce the substance of
the openGL Racket binding has to be replaced.
